  abstract = {Water-retention properties of soils vary according to soil characteristics,
	and the understanding of their variation remains controversial. Numerous
	pedotransfer functions (ptfs) that enable prediction of the water-retention
	properties of soils were developed, but their validity was poorly
	discussed. In this study, we compare the performances of textural
	and texturo-structural class ptfs with more sophisticated class and
	continuous ptfs developed using the same set of soils. We showed
	that the former led to prediction performances that are better than,
	or similar to, those recorded with the more sophisticated class and
	continuous ptfs studied. Thus, textural and texturo-structural class
	ptfs that are quite easy to establish are potentially worthwhile
	tools for predicting the water-retention properties of soils, particularly
	at scales for which semi-quantitative or qualitative basic soil characteristics,
	such as the texture, are the only characteristics available. More
	generally, our results pointed out that the discussion of ptfs performance
	should refer to those recorded with easy to establish ptfs, thus
	enabling to quantify how much prediction bias and precision can be
	gained when increasing the complexity of ptfs and, consequently,
	the number and quality of predictors required.},

  abstract = {The Beerkan Estimation of Soil Transfer parameters (BEST) procedure
	seems attractive for soil hydraulic characterization but it has received
	little testing so far. The objective of this investigation was to
	test BEST with different application approaches for some soils in
	Burundi, where there is the need of using simple methods to characterize
	soils. Most (14) of the 19 sampled sites had a clay soil texture
	whereas texture ranged from silty clay to loam in the other cases.
	On average, the fitting ability of both the particle size distribution
	(PSD) model (mean relative error, Me(Er) = 2.0%) and the cumulative
	infiltration model (Me(Er) = 2.3%) was good according to recommended
	evaluation criteria. Using the complete set of measured cumulative
	infiltration data instead of the limited data set required by the
	transient infiltration equation did not affect the predicted scale
	parameters and the calculated soil physical quality indicators. Using
	reduced experimental information on the PSD (sedimentation time <= 60 min
	instead of <= 2880 min; percentages of particles lower than 0.002,
	0.05 and 2.0 mm) did not have any statistically significant effect
	on the predicted parameters of the water retention curve and hydraulic
	conductivity function, and yielded minimal change in the assessed
	soil physical quality measures. Worse results were obtained with
	recently proposed pedotransfer functions to estimate the water retention
	shape parameter. In conclusion, the BEST procedure should be expected
	to yield a reliable hydraulic characterization of the sampled soils.
	From a practical point of view, estimating the duration of the transient
	phase of infiltration does not seem to be a crucial step of the data
	analysis procedure; and limited experimental information on the PSD
	can be used to predict soil hydraulic properties in fine-textured
	soils.},

  abstract = {Soil hydraulic properties, mainly saturated and unsaturated hydraulic
	conductivity and water retention, are crucial input parameters in
	any modelling study on water flow and solute transport in soils.
	However, direct measurement techniques remain relatively time consuming,
	labour intensive and expensive. Fortunately, they may be predicted
	by forming a mathematical relationship between relatively easily
	collected soil survey parameters, such as soil texture, bulk density
	and organic matter content, and less readily available soil properties,
	such as water retention or hydraulic conductivity. These mathematical
	relationships, pedotransfer functions (PTFs), allow the transfer
	of data we have into data we need. In recent years many PTFs have
	been created with the aid of artificial neural networks (ANNs). We
	describe a PTF modelling method that combines a number of individual
	ANNs - the ensemble method - and compare directly the results obtained
	with those achieved by a competing single ANN method. The ensemble
	method is shown to produce significantly more accurate and robust
	PTFs when compared to single ANN methods, under the same conditions.
	These ANN-PTF ensembles have been optimised to produce maximum benefits
	from the ensemble method, whilst minimising data correlations between
	training and test data. Consideration has been given to how much
	data is required in the training and testing phases of modelling,
	and how many individual ANNs should be combined to produce the ensemble.
	We also demonstrate that the current terminology used to describe
	various portions of the dataset in the single ANN method is insufficient
	when describing such portions in the ensemble method. As a consequence,
	new terminology is introduced. Furthermore, we establish that data
	may be recycled, i.e. used in both the training and testing phases
	of the ANN-PTF ensemble with virtually no loss of precision. This
	report shows that, for the water retention data investigated here,
	the ensemble method requires significantly less data than does the
	single ANN method - more than 2 1/2 times less - to produce results
	of equivalent precision. This is a crucial result because, since
	ANN-PTFs formed from local data produce more accurate predictions
	than those built from data spread from a wider area, the concept
	of data conservation becomes a critical factor in ANN-PTF construction.},

  abstract = {This paper presents results of a model comparison study within the
	LUCHEM framework ([`]assessing the impact of Land Use Change on Hydrology
	by Ensemble Modelling') where the effects of land use change on catchment
	water balances were assessed with various hydrological catchment
	models. The motivation for this part of LUCHEM is that it is well
	known that land use changes may induce changes in soil chemical and
	soil physical properties (e.g. bulk density). Unfortunately the effects
	of land use change on soil hydraulic properties are seldom investigated
	directly, but some information on changes in bulk density is available.
	Changes in bulk density can be used as input for pedotransfer functions
	to derive changes in soil hydraulic model parameters. In this study,
	three different catchment models (SWAT, TOPLATS, WASIM) are compared
	with respect to their sensitivity to land use change with and without
	consideration of associated changes in soil parameterisation. The
	results reveal that different models show a different sensitivity
	to the change in soil parameterisation while the magnitude of absolute
	changes in simulated evapotranspiration and discharge is similar.
	SWAT calculates largest changes in the water balance in a German
	mesoscale catchment. TOPLATS also shows significant changes in the
	calculated catchment water balances as well as in the runoff generation
	while WASIM reacts least sensitive. While TOPLATS and WASIM show
	similar patterns with respect to changes in the water flows for all
	subcatchments and land use scenarios, SWAT results are similar for
	the different catchments, but show scenario specific patterns. In
	relation to the magnitude of the effects on simulated water flows
	induced by land use change, the significance of considering soil
	change effects depends on both, the scenario definition and on the
	model sensitivity to soil parameterisation. For two of the three
	land use scenarios representing an intensified land use, SWAT and
	TOPLATS simulate water balance changes in the same order of magnitude
	due to both, land use and soil property changes. Therefore, a consideration
	of changes in soil properties as part of land use change scenario
	analysis is recommended. Future field work needs to aim at the validation
	of the assumed dependency of soil hydrologic properties on land use
	change.},

  abstract = {Estimates of soil water retention characteristics using pedotransfer
	functions (PTFs) are useful in many studies, such as hydrological
	modelling and soil mapping. The objective of this study was to calibrate
	and validate point and parametric PTF models based on neural networks
	and the Bootstrap method using different sets of predictors. The
	point PTF models estimated retention points at -1, -10, -100, and
	-1500 kPa pressure and the parametric PTF models estimated the van
	Genuchten retention parameters. A Danish soil data set (3226 horizons)
	dominated by sandy and sandy loamy soils was used in the analysis.
	The data were split up into a calibration data set (N=1618 horizons)
	and a testing data set (N=1608). The data were evaluated with the
	root mean square residuals (RMSR) and the Akaike Information Criterion
	(AIC), both obtained from measured and predicted water contents at
	the four retention points. The results for the point PTF models show
	similar predictions using detailed soil textural classification (seven
	textural classes) compared to a simplified textural classification
	(sand, silt, and clay). In general, we found that adding bulk density
	(BD) and soil organic matter (SOM) as predictors increased the prediction
	capability. The RMSR values varied between 0.037 and 0.051 cm3 cm-3
	and the lowest RMSR values were found for the models that used the
	most detailed data. The AIC followed the change in RMSR closely.
	The RMSR values for the parametric PTF models were generally 0.011
	cm3 cm-3 higher than the point PTF models using the same predictors.
	This was mainly due to an imperfect fit of the van Genuchten retention
	model to the retention data at 1500 kPa. Adding measured soil water
	content at -10 kPa in the parametric PTF models reduced the RMSR
	by 0.006 cm3 cm-3. Adding additional soil water contents measured
	at -1 kPa, -100 kPa, and -1500 kPa improved the predictions only
	to a minor degree. The uncertainty in the prediction of water content
	using both the point and parametric PTF increased with increasing
	clay content. Another finding was that the absolute uncertainty in
	point PTF predictions of water content at -10 kPa was generally higher
	than the uncertainty found at -1, -100, and -1500 kPa.},

  abstract = {Soil survey data are required for different kinds of environmental
	and agronomic studies, especially for estimating general soil quality
	indicators such as Available Water Capacity (AWC) over large areas.
	Generally, AWC estimates take the form of a unique value per soil
	class, and the uncertainty pervading these estimates is not assessed,
	although it is of crucial importance for the users. To overcome this
	problem without requiring expensive-to-measure data, we propose an
	alternative approach which estimates AWC from two different types
	of information currently available in soil databases: (i) imprecise
	descriptions of soil classes, i.e. synthesis profiles or qualitative
	descriptions of soil classes, (ii) pedotransfer functions and other
	statistical relations between input soil properties. The imprecise
	descriptions of soil classes were considered as sets of fuzzy intervals
	of values of soil properties and represented by possibility distributions.
	Statistical relations were translated into fuzzy relations of soil
	properties by applying a "probability-to-possibility" transformation.
	AWC was then estimated by means of a fuzzy interval calculus that
	was implemented as a Constraint Satisfaction Problem (CSP), allowing
	the representation of relations between the variables. AWC estimates
	were expressed by possibility distributions that were translated
	into a set of prediction intervals corresponding to different possibility
	levels. The approach was applied to the estimation of the AWC from
	soil class descriptions from three detailed soil maps in the Languedoc
	plain (southern France). The validation study demonstrated that the
	proposed approach provided reliable but fairly imprecise estimates,
	which allows the soil classes to be ranked with respect to the AWC.
	The best reliability-precision compromise was obtained at possibility
	level of 0.8 by using qualitative descriptions as a data source.
	Because it only uses currently available information of soil databases,
	the proposed approach can be extensively used in the future for regional
	applications which allow for a certain amount of (known) imprecision,
	or in studies aimed at defining improvements to existing soil databases.},

	data have used basic soil texture and structure information as inputs.
	Inclusion of surrogate/supplementary data such as topography and
	vegetation information has shown some improvement in the PTF's ability
	to estimate more accurate soil hydraulic parameters. Artificial neural
	networks (ANNs) are a popular tool for PTF development, and are usually
	applied across matching spatial scales of inputs and outputs. However,
	different hydrologic, hydro-climatic, and contaminant transport models
	require input data at different scales, all of which may not be easily
	available from existing databases. In such a scenario, it becomes
	necessary to scale the soil hydraulic parameter values estimated
	by PTFs to suit the model requirements. Also, uncertainties in the
	predictions need to be quantified to enable users to gauge the suitability
	of a particular dataset in their applications. Bayesian Neural Networks
	(BNNs) inherently provide uncertainty estimates for their outputs
	due to their utilization of Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) techniques.
	In this paper, we present a PTF methodology to estimate soil water
	retention characteristics built on a Bayesian framework for training
	of neural networks and utilizing several in situ and remotely sensed
	datasets jointly. The BNN is also applied across spatial scales to
	provide fine scale outputs when trained with coarse scale data. Our
	training data inputs include ground/remotely sensed soil texture,
	bulk density, elevation, and Leaf Area Index (LAI) at 1 km resolutions,
	while similar properties measured at a point scale are used as fine
	scale inputs. The methodology was tested at two different hydro-climatic
	regions. We also tested the effect of varying the support scale of
	the training data for the BNNs by sequentially aggregating finer
	resolution training data to coarser resolutions, and the applicability
	of the technique to upscaling problems. The BNN outputs are corrected
	for bias using a non-linear CDF-matching technique. Final results
	show good promise of the suitability of this Bayesian Neural Network
	approach for soil hydraulic parameter estimation across spatial scales
	using ground-, air-, or space-based remotely sensed geophysical parameters.
	Inclusion of remotely sensed data such as elevation and LAI in addition
	to in situ soil physical properties improved the estimation capabilities
	of the BNN-based PTF in certain conditions.},

  abstract = {Application of process-based water flow and solute transport models
	is often hampered by insufficient knowledge of soil hydraulic properties.
	This is certainly true for dual- or multi-porosity models that account
	for non-equilibrium flow of water in macropores, where the saturated
	[`]matrix' hydraulic conductivity is a particularly critical parameter.
	Direct measurement is possible, but this is impractical for larger
	scale studies (i.e. catchment or regional), where estimation methods
	(pedotransfer functions) are usually required. This paper presents
	pedotransfer functions for hydraulic conductivity at a pressure head
	of -10 cm, K10, based on measurements of near-saturated hydraulic
	conductivity made with tension infiltrometers in 70 soil horizons
	at 37 different sites in 13 different countries. Pedotransfer functions
	were developed using texture classes, the geometric mean particle
	size, organic carbon content, bulk density and effective porosity
	as predictor variables. The pedotransfer functions explained no more
	than 12% to 29% of the variation in K10 for the complete dataset.
	Some important sources of unexplained variation in K10 may include
	errors and uncertainty in the (indirect) method used to measure K10,
	differences in the way the tension infiltrometer is used, and also
	temporal changes in hydraulic conductivity due to tillage and/or
	surface sealing. The importance of tillage was emphasized by the
	fact that excluding arable topsoils from the analysis gave improved
	predictions (r2 values between 26% and 44%) for pedotransfer functions
	based on texture classes, mean particle size and effective porosity.},

	a small agriculture-dominated catchment in South-east Norway and
	to assess implications of variability in texture and carbon content
	on land management operations, using the predicted maximum water
	content for optimum workability as an example. Information from three
	different sources were used: a soil map (1:5000), a large sample
	grid (100 m spacing, 270 ha extent), and a small sample grid (10 m
	spacing, 2.25 ha extent). Readily available information on texture
	and organic matter content from the soil map was found to be of limited
	use for soil management due to broad textural classes together with
	deviations from the mapped main textural classes. There were significant
	differences in clay, silt and sand content between the different
	soil textural classes on the soil map. Statistical distributions
	within soil map units were generally either positively or negatively
	skewed and the coefficient of variation was intermediate, 15-50%.
	Most of the variation in both grids was spatially correlated. The
	large grid was dominated by a patchy structure, whilst the small
	grid showed a systematic trend with a gradual transition indicating
	fuzzy boundaries between map units in this catchment. The effective
	range for texture was 16 times larger in the large grid. Implications
	of variability in texture and carbon content on land management operations
	were assessed for the maximum water content for optimum workability
	(Wopt), predicted using pedotransfer functions. Wopt was usually
	in the same range as the water content at-100 kPa matric potential,
	indicating that considerable evaporation in addition to drainage
	is required for obtaining workable conditions in the field. The time
	required for obtaining the water content was estimated to about 5
	days, which is longer than an average length of periods without precipitation
	in the area, median 3.7 days. Wopt predicted from the soil map deviated
	strongly from Wopt predicted from the sample grids. Comparing estimates
	of Wopt from the large grid with measurements in the small grid showed
	differences corresponding to ±2-3 days of evaporation.},

	First, the guiding principles of prediction and the type of predictors

	tropics have higher clay content, lower cation exchange capacity,
	higher bulk density, lower water content at - 10 kPa and - 1500 kPa

	by the sand, silt and clay content of a soil. However, a number of
	standards exist and are in use internationally to describe PSD and
	particle-size classes. Additionally, some authors use derived particle-size
	information, such as the geometric mean diameter and its standard
	deviation as input to their predictive equations. We compared the
	usefulness of some of the most common representations of the PSD
	in estimating water retention at - 33 and - 1500 kPa, using Group
	Method of Data Handling and data of three databases. The cutoff limit
	between silt and sand content has been simulated to be at 20, 50

	mean diameter and its standard deviation as predictors. We examined
	the effect of using the wrong cutoff limit in the PSD curve while
	applying a PTF. Overall, we could not point out one particular representation

	two parameters did not result in significantly different estimates

	particle-size classes as input. We found no evidence suggesting that
	using interpolated data would reduce the accuracy of the estimation
	of these soil hydraulic properties. It is not straightforward to
	pre-determine if using the wrong definition of the silt/sand boundary
	in the PSD data will result in significant loss of estimation accuracy
	or not; therefore, using such data should be avoided. Our study suggests

	SWRC parameters for each soil sample in the database. Using a quasi-random

	"test" (TEST) parts containing 225 and 80 soil samples, respectively.
	Linear PTFs for the SWRC parameters were calculated for the EVAL

	dry bulk density, organic matter content, and the sand/silt ratio,
	as well as simple transforms (such as logarithms and products) of

	the eight most significant were used to calculate the different PTFs.
	A nonlinear (NL) predictive method was obtained by substituting the
	linear PTFs directly into the SWRC equation, and subsequently adjusting
	the PTF parameters to all retention data of the EVAL database. The
	estimation error (SSQ) and efficiency (EE) were used to compare the

	that EE of the EVAL and the TEST databases increased by 4 and 7%,

	further increase EE, one measured retention data point was used as
	an additional (concomitant) variable in the PTFs. Using the 20 kPa
	water retention data point in the linear PTFs improved the EE by
	about 25% for the TEST data set. Nonlinear adjustment of the concomitant

	data set containing detailed measurements of 63 German soil horizons,
	to which none of the models had been previously calibrated, were
	used for the evaluation of pedo-transfer functions. The paper considers
	only pedo-transfer functions which have shown good results in the
	past. The statistical analysis of the eight functions shows that
	the model of Wösten [J.H.M., Wösten, Pedotransfer functions to evaluate
	soil quality. In: E.G., Gregorich, M.R., Carter, (Eds.), Soil Quality
	for Crop Production and Ecosystem Health. Developments in Soils Science,
	vol. 25, Elsevier, (1997) 221-245.], which requires an input of measured
	saturated hydraulic conductivity, performs best in terms of prediction
	of the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity. Evaluation of the unsaturated
	hydraulic conductivity by the pedo-transfer functions shows, on average,
	better correlations if the saturated hydraulic conductivity (an input
	parameter) is also obtained from predictions of pedo-transfer functions
	rather than directly from experiments. This outcome is attributed
	to a dependence of the saturated hydraulic conductivity on soil structure,
	i.e. macropores, while the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity is
	generally more dependent on soil texture. The deviating results of
	estimated soil hydraulic conductivity, as compared to the experimental
	data, indicate that the use of pedo-transfer functions based only
	on estimated soil hydraulic parameters must be carried out with great
	caution.},

  abstract = {Water retention and hydraulic conductivity are crucial input parameters
	in any modelling study on water flow and solute transport in soils.
	Due to inherent temporal and spatial variability in these hydraulic
	characteristics, large numbers of samples are required to properly
	characterise areas of land. Hydraulic characteristics can be obtained
	from direct laboratory and field measurements. However, these measurements
	are time consuming which makes it costly to characterise an area
	of land. As an alternative, analysis of existing databases of measured
	soil hydraulic data may result in pedotransfer functions. In practise,
	these functions often prove to be good predictors for missing soil
	hydraulic characteristics. Examples are presented of different equations
	describing hydraulic characteristics and of pedotransfer functions
	used to predict parameters in these equations. Grouping of data prior
	to pedotransfer function development is discussed as well as the
	use of different soil properties as predictors. In addition to regression
	analysis, new techniques such as artificial neural networks, group
	methods of data handling, and classification and regression trees
	are increasingly being used for pedotransfer function development.
	Actual development of pedotransfer functions is demonstrated by describing
	a practical case study. Examples are presented of pedotransfer function
	for predicting other than hydraulic characteristics. Accuracy and
	reliability of pedotransfer functions are demonstrated and discussed.
	In this respect, functional evaluation of pedotransfer functions
	proves to be a good tool to assess the desired accuracy of a pedotransfer
	function for a specific application.},
