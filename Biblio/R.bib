	it in your own
	
	time so it’s probably the least painful introduction to R currently
	around. Make sure you have
	
	the example files that accompany this text (“first.r”, “mystery.r”,
	“quadrats.r” and
	
	“quadratdata”) otherwise many things won’t make sense. Start reading
	below the line of stars
	
	and all should be self-explanatory including how to install R in the
	first place (if necessary).},
